# GitHub Repo Describer

An intelligent tool designed to streamline your repository management. This application automatically identifies your GitHub repositories that are missing a description, uses the Google Gemini AI to generate a concise and relevant summary from the `README.md` file, and allows you to update it directly on GitHub with a single click.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Connects to your GitHub account securely using a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope.
- **Automatic Repository Discovery**: Fetches and displays a list of your public, non-forked repositories that currently lack a description.
- **AI-Powered Generation**: Leverages the Google Gemini API to analyze the content of your `README.md` file and generate a high-quality, one-sentence description.
- **One-Click Updates**: Seamlessly push the generated description directly to your repository on GitHub, eliminating manual copy-pasting.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: The UI updates instantly, removing repositories from the list as you update them.
- **Clean & Responsive UI**: A modern, easy-to-use interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.

## üöÄ How It Works

1.  **Authorize**: Provide a GitHub Personal Access Token with the `repo` scope to grant the application the necessary permissions.
2.  **Fetch Repos**: The app automatically fetches your repositories and filters for those without descriptions.
3.  **Generate**: For any repository in the list, click "Generate Description". The app reads the `README.md` and asks the Gemini AI to summarize it.
4.  **Review & Update**: Review the AI-generated description. If you like it, click "Update on GitHub" to apply it to your repository instantly.
